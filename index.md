## About the application

The **Covidometr App** finds the probability to encounter a contagious person in public spaces across the US. The probability is found based upon the most recent infection data. You can also find the probability of positive cases within a group of people of arbitrary size.

During these hard times, have you ever wondered "how likely is it to pass near a person carrying the virus at a grocery store?" or "if I get on a train with 30 people on board, what's the probability that at least one of them is positive?". 
These are the kind of questions that Covidometr aims at answering.

- Compute the proportion of population that is contagious at any given time at any given US location. This is in contrast with the official data normally released by health authorities, which typically includes only the number of new positive cases.
- Compute the probability of one person being contagious, as well as the probability of at least one positive case within a group of people of arbitrary size.
- Arbitrarily set the value of the parameters needed: the proportion of new infections that go undetected and the length of time that a person is contagious for.

This app was developed by a group of developers and data scientists living (sheltering in place) in Silicon Valley.
